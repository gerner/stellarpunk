## "The Lead", Investigative Reporter

While docked at a station you get a message from the manager of a different
station. He says you're about to get a request to transport someone to his
station. He wants you to accept, but instead of taking her to his station, he
wants you to head to a location he'll give you and hand the passenger over to
some asociates that will be waiting for you. He'll pay you twice what she
offers to do this. He appreciates your discretion.

Later, while you're at the station, you get a message from someone that wants
transport to a station, as expected. She says she's on a deadline and needs to
get there urgently.

You can agree to help her (starting the story chain) or decide to stay out of
it (having no dramatic effect, but maybe we play coy about the impact).

Next, you can take her to her destination or the location the station manager
gave you. Take too long to do either and she'll jump ship and find a different
way on her own. This should be similar to other sorts of transport missions.

It turns out she's a reporter investigating a criminal conspiracy in the
sector. She thinks the station she's booked passage to is a hub for criminal
activity and wants to poke around. If you help her, nothing seems to happen
right away. Maybe she contacts you again in the future. Maybe she dies
mysteriously (maybe both!)

The station manager that contacted you is actually a leutenant in an organized
crime ring. His associates are low-level thugs that will intimidate or kill the
reporter.  This leaves plenty of loose ends to tie up. If you do as he asks,
nothing immediately happens. But he'll get back in touch with you in the
future, to get more involved in the crime ring.

Given the setting, the criminal and semi-criminal world is the norm. Helping
her is dangerous. Any station manager is a powerful figure, a leutenant in a
crime much more so. And maybe things get morally ambiguous after the big
opener. Maybe the station manager is a hard-but-fair leader, mentor, mission
giver type.

Following up on the investigation might be rewarding from a story perspective.
Likely the conclusion will be more status quo than reveletory for the sector.
