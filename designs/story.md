Stellarpunk
===========

The goal of Stellarpunk is to have emergent stories and to string together your
own story as you play some character. The universe is alive around you with
characters living their own lives: mining, trading, managing a station or
habitat, running a pirate gang, killing pirates for bounty as a mercenary,
policing a sector to keep violence down between gangs and mercenaries, etc.

Whenever there's an interaction, you should ask, "who else is involved?" or
"who's behind this and why are they involved?" Having a real answer to these
questions is what makes the universe alive.

The "story" of Stellarpunk is emergent from the economic and interpersonal
conditions in the game.

# Aesthetic and Lore

## A Traumatic History and A Present of Survival

The universe as the player might experience it is disconnected from what we
might naturally expect for future development. No one is running around in the
sunshine living in a tech utopia. Something, or more likely many things,
happened in the past that made all of that impossible. Maybe society
experienced a singularity and now all that's left is those that were left
behind in some kind of waste-land galaxy. Maybe super intelligent AIs ran amok,
destroying infrastructure before escaping to some unknown space. Maybe disease,
polution and resource over-extraction left the rich home worlds as
uninhabitable slag heaps. Maybe technology simply never progressed beyond
modulated digital signals on noisy analog communication channels.

Regardless of why, humanity as we know it and might interact with now exists on
habitats, scraping by on recycled air, water and hand-me-down equipment and
parts. A few brave souls live outside the habs on utilitarian starships and
stations gathering resources and producing goods to support those back home.
Those that have little to no sense of societal responsibilities prey on those
that do. Or they seek to maximize profit to support some sense of luxury on the
backs of everyone else.

All of that given, people still seek pleasure and relaxation. And of course
society provides those things in limited amounts. Media exists, whether that's
news and information, or written, visual and video art and entertainment. Food,
drink and familiar physical pleasures all exist too. Many of these are
commodities that need to be transported, produced on one hab for export to
another.

Every character in the game exists in this universe. They are largely absorbed
with the task of simple survival. They may seek to eke out some kind of
improved circumstances by whatever means are available. The vast majority of
the population is poor and subject to harsh employment by a limited upper
class.

## Modempunk

Retro, lo-fi computing and connectivity. No instant information across the
universe becase they use super low bitrate communication, so it's extremely
expensive to transmit information over long distances. Maybe some super
wealthy/powerful folks can do it, but most people rely on lo-fi communication
that might be very out of date.

This helps to explain why getting price information is so tricky.

## Jobs, Careers, Occupations

Core production chain economy:
These are things that directly impact the production chain economy. These
already (as of 2024-12-31) have logic in the game.
* Miner: paid by employer or by selling goods
* Trader: paid by employer or by selling goods
* Station Manager: paid by employer or by selling goods

Other Jobs supporting the economy or just adding flavor:
* Explorer: gathers and distributes economic information (e.g. prices), simply
  travels between stations and to other sectors. That information is valuable
  to other characters (traders, miners, station managers) who pay the explorer.
* Pirate: attack ships for cargo (stations?). paid by selling stolen cargo to
  stations.
* Mercenary: attack known pirates for bounty. paid by bounty offered by some
  other character.
* Law Enforcement Officer (LEO): intervene in conflicts in civilized areas.
  Attack the instigator of violence, and/or come to defense of characters
  according to some criteria (relationship, organizational membership, etc.
  Paid for by government / pseudo government "org".
* Courier: carry information, other characters, non-production-chain items from
  one place to another. Paid by other characters (passenger, characters that
  want misc news or misc items)
* Ship/Station Crew: necessary worker on a ship/station. many flavors of this?
  Paid by ship captain or ship owner.
* Hab worker: misc worker on a hab. might travel from one place to another on
  misc business. many flavors of this. Paid by government / pseudo government
  "org"

Ideas:
* Explorers collect asteroid/resource and station locations as well as trade
  prices. They distribute this information to traders and station managers.
* Pirates hunt for cargo. If they have cargo they'll try and sell it, with
  similar profit maximization as traders.Ships drop some portion of their cargo
  on destruction. Pirates ask traders and miners to drop their cargo (all of
  it) before attacking (for a smaller
  payout, and paying the cost of combat). Pirates get a bounty (somehow)
* Mercenaries have a list of bounties and simply travel around looking to
  identify a ship on their bounty list and engage in combat. On destruction
  they get paid (or have to collect the bounty?)

Questions:
* What are "orgs" here?
* What do characters personally do with money? Do they need to pay for food,
  water, air, space to sleep and live? Do they desire for other things they
  need money to obtain? See below
* Where does money go? how does it travel through the economy (beyond the
  production chain) See below
* Do ship crew have game mechanics?

## Money Flow

Stellarpunk has a production chain with resources and goods which offers a
concrete way to interact with the economy. Underpinning this economy is a flow
of money. Trades through the production chain is one way money flows. In this
case money flows from habs (the ultimate consumers in the production chain) to
traders and station managers.

Another way money flows is throgh fuel and life support. These are generic
goods needed by ships and stations to function properly. Habs produce these
goods and offer them for sale to dedicated fuel and life support traders who
distribute them to stations for sale to ships. This completes the cycle of
income.

Habs here are unlimited buffers which can take up any slack in the economy.
In principle, they can consume an unlimited amount of production goods, produce
an unlimited amount of fuel and lifesupport goods, and have unlimited money.
There's no underlying game mechanic limitations on this part of the income
cycle they way there is on other parts of the production chain where stations
require raw resources or input goods to produce output goods and money must
exchange hands to move those resources and goods through the production chain.

Habs can be used to artificailly create interesting game dynamics like
shortages or surpluses of fuel/life support goods, or drains or injections of
money into the economy. For instance, all of the habs in one particular sector
might be unable to produce fuel, creating a need for cross-sector trade. In
another case the game might create a temporary shortage of money on a
particular hab, making it unable to buy any production goods until a certain
amount of fuel or life support goods are purchased. If the economic cycle is
failing to distribute lifesupport or fuel goods the game can create an
abundance of low-priced goods in response. These situations can be manipulated
at habs to create a dynamic and interesting economy.

# Content Ideas

## "The Lead", Investigative Reporter

While docked at a station you get a message from the manager of a different
station. He says you're about to get a request to transport someone to his
station. He wants you to accept, but instead of taking her to his station, he
wants you to head to a location he'll give you and hand the passenger over to
some asociates that will be waiting for you. He'll pay you twice what she
offers to do this. He appreciates your discretion.

Later, while you're at the station, you get a message from someone that wants
transport to a station, as expected. She says she's on a deadline and needs to
get there urgently.

You can agree to help her (starting the story chain) or decide to stay out of
it (having no dramatic effect, but maybe we play coy about the impact).

Next, you can take her to her destination or the location the station manager
gave you. Take too long to do either and she'll jump ship and find a different
way on her own. This should be similar to other sorts of transport missions.

...TBD content...

It turns out she's a reporter investigating a criminal conspiracy in the
sector. She thinks the station she's booked passage to is a hub for criminal
activity and wants to poke around. If you help her, nothing seems to happen
right away. Maybe she contacts you again in the future. Maybe she dies
mysteriously (maybe both!)

The station manager that contacted you is actually a leutenant in an organized
crime ring. His associates are low-level thugs that will intimidate or kill the
reporter.  This leaves plenty of loose ends to tie up. If you do as he asks,
nothing immediately happens. But he'll get back in touch with you in the
future, to get more involved in the crime ring.

Given the setting, the criminal and semi-criminal world is the norm. Helping
her is dangerous. Any station manager is a powerful figure, a leutenant in a
crime much more so. And maybe things get morally ambiguous after the big
opener. Maybe the station manager is a hard-but-fair leader, mentor, mission
giver type.

Following up on the investigation might be rewarding from a story perspective.
Likely the conclusion will be more status quo than reveletory for the sector.

## New Hab Miner Start

Player starts as a new miner. They don't own anything, work for a refinery
station manager who works for a hab. They're on a mining ship and get direct
instructions from the station manager. This is like a tutorial.

They get instructions to set up their agenda for mining and to mine some
resources. There's more tutorial stuff to follow. This leads to a path that
gets them free of direct, explicit supervision, but maybe the player can short
circuit that.

* Set up Mining Agendum (only allowed to mine given resource, sell to refinery)
* Mine a full load of resources
* Deliver to station
* Set up Trading Agendum (only allowed to buy refined good from refinery, sell
  to any station)
* Pick up refined goods from same station
* Sell to different station (not owned by the hab)
* Repeat this process until something happens (level up agenda?)

Intro comms from the refinery agent (simiarly working for the hab):

So you're the new miner fresh from the hab. Whatever your story, a criminal or
one of those "idealistic" types, I don't want to know. Let's try not to get you
killed before you've recouped the cost of pilot placement.

Your job is to mine ore and ferry refined materials for this station. If it
wasn't obvious this is what's keeping the hab habitable, so try not to frack it
up. I'm your boss, just like the admin at the hab is my boss. We've both got
quotas to meet, so follow orders, and let's get going.

Can you handle some mining in this vessel they've got you in, or do you need
some hand holding? (Y/N to enter basic manuevering and mining tutorial)

...Tutorial goes here (manual piloting controls, docking with the station, zoom
controls, navigating to the asteroid, mining the asteroid)...

Alright, go grab a full load of RESOURCE and dock back here at STATION to drop
it off.

...MANAGER sends comms after some period of time if they don't return fast
enough...

...Player returns with the goods...

Get that ore unloaded and we can get started on the second half of your job:
transporting refined materials between stations.

You got this one covered or should I walk you through it? (Y/N to enter trading
tutorial)

## Production Chain

Depending on how many tries it takes, we could tell a story about trying to scrape together a way to survive using equipment and technology left over from the expansion. Very few tries => it was easy to become self sufficient. Many tries => lots of failed attempts to design and build production systems.

Potentially use information about the resulting production chain to describe the products. E.g. if a high-tech resource only uses only a single base resource. E.g. a product that is used in all or nearly all products in the next rank is a critical lynch-pin.
