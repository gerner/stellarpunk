# Ideas

## Collision Avoidance

* project threats ahead of current threat toward the current threat, coalesce
  to help with flapping threats?
* switch to A\* in dense areas of static threats?
* CBDR rework: both ships should do something that will work if the other does
  nothing, but if both follow the protocol, collision should be avoided.
* other ideas to simultaneously avoid all nearby threats?
