Character Dynamics
==================

# Goals

- [ ] Characters have relationships with any other character
- [ ] Those relationships change character behaviors
- [ ] Relationships act as a form of progression, unlocking mechanics/opps
- [ ] Faction/member relationships
- [ ] Employer/employee relationships
- [ ] Organizations (company, faction) are things
- [ ] Employees/faction-members have behavior on behalf of employer/faction
      (aka jobs and jobs direct action)
- [ ] Not all characters are captains
- [ ] Relationships are impacted by actions
- [ ] Relationships are impacted by background (is this just a compressed set
      of actions?)
- [ ] Characters have missions/tasks they want performed and post, other characters take on those tasks/missions and accomplish them

It goes without saying, the player character participates in all of this.

# Factions

Do factions have a single leader? what if they die?

How is a faction relationship different than a relationship with the leader?

What characterizes a faction?
* name
* assets
* members
* leader(s)
* relationships with other factions and with characters

A faction member's relationship with a character is affected by, but separate
from the faction relationship with that character.

# Missions/Tasks

See `designs/missions.md` for details.
