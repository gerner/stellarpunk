# Display for Player

Player only gets to see SensorImage objects, not the underlying entity, unless
strictly necessary or the player's ship has fully resolved the object.

### Issues/TODOs
* icons and other entity display concerns for sensor images
* various target properties generally needed which might not be accessible if a
  sensor image is copied.
