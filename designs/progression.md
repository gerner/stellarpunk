# Questlets

AKA achievements? This is sort of like major decisions in CKIII.

* unlock on certain conditions (e.g. having had one or several agenda item
  equipped for a certain time)
* fulfilled by other conditions (e.g. make a certain number of trades, etc.)
* achieving a questlet gives you rewards like new agenda slot (capped or
  unlocking a specific slot so there's not unlimited options for this), bonuses
  to activities, etc.
* take an agenda item to pursue it or to improve pursuing it. The longer the
  agenda item is equipped it the better the rewards.
* makes certain play styles more concrete (e.g. piracy, political domination,
  hostile mercantilism, etc.). But don't be overly prescriptive!

# Agenda experience

Characters can take agenda items like "cards". These are sort of FF Tactics
jobs. They get access to certain abilities and the card gains experience
unlocking additional abilities. Some (or all?) of these abilities can be used
even if the card isn't currently active. These unlocked abilities might be
perks (see below).

Agenda cards slowly level up, or generate experience as you have them active.
This encourages keeping agenda cards active and makes agenda slots valuable.
Getting experience might make the activity more effective or play into other
kinds of progression (see questlets). Maybe you get to keep some of that
progression somehow (see questlets?).

# Perks
* no penalty to own sensors while in sector weather
* scan ships to see cargo
* use sensors of friendly/controlled units (e.g. missiles you launch)
* directly control (to some extent) missiles you launch (a la silent waters)
* auto-pilot
