## Questlets

AKA achievements? This is sort of like major decisions in CKIII.

* unlock on certain conditions (e.g. having had one or several agenda item equipped for a certain time)
* fulfilled by other conditions (e.g. make a certain number of trades, etc.)
* achieving a questlet gives you rewards like new agenda slot (capped or unlocking a specific slot so there's not unlimited options for this), bonuses to activities, etc.
* take an agenda item to pursue it or to improve pursuing it. The longer the agenda item is equipped it the better the rewards.
* makes certain play styles more concrete (e.g. piracy, political domination, hostile mercantilism, etc.). But don't be overly prescriptive!

## Agenda experience

Agenda items slowly level up, or generate experience as you have them equipped. This encourages keeping agenda items equipped and makes agenda slots valuable. Getting experience might make the activity more effective or play into other kinds of progression (see questlets). Maybe you get to keep some of that progression somehow (see questlets?).
