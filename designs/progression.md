# Questlets

AKA achievements? This is sort of like major decisions in CKIII.

* unlock on certain conditions (e.g. having had one or several agenda item
  equipped for a certain time)
* fulfilled by other conditions (e.g. make a certain number of trades, etc.)
* achieving a questlet gives you rewards like new agenda slot (capped or
  unlocking a specific slot so there's not unlimited options for this), bonuses
  to activities, etc.
* take an agenda item to pursue it or to improve pursuing it. The longer the
  agenda item is equipped it the better the rewards.
* makes certain play styles more concrete (e.g. piracy, political domination,
  hostile mercantilism, etc.). But don't be overly prescriptive!

# Agenda experience

Characters can take agenda items like "cards". These are sort of FF Tactics
jobs. They get access to certain abilities and the card gains experience
unlocking additional abilities. Some (or all?) of these abilities can be used
even if the card isn't currently active. These unlocked abilities might be
perks (see below).

Agenda cards slowly level up, or generate experience as you have them active.
This encourages keeping agenda cards active and makes agenda slots valuable.
Getting experience might make the activity more effective or play into other
kinds of progression (see questlets). Maybe you get to keep some of that
progression somehow (see questlets?).

# Perks
* no penalty to own sensors while in sector weather
* scan ships to see cargo
* use sensors of friendly/controlled units (e.g. missiles you launch)
* directly control (to some extent) missiles you launch (a la silent waters)
* auto-pilot

# Gaining Money

Of course. Money can be gained from a variety of activities:

* Mining
* Trading goods
* Selling Intel (maybe buying and selling intel!)
* Scripted event chains
* Missions, including bounties
* Producing and selling goods at a station (i.e. controlling a station)
* Running a transport network (i.e. controlling travel gates)
* Charging docking fees
* Being a subordinate of another character/faction
* Bribery

Money can be used for number of things:

* Buying/building ships
* Buying/building stations
* Ship/station maintenance
* Paying subordinates
* Trading goods
* Buying goods for production
* Paying for other characters to do missions
* Buying intel/news
* Bribery
* Paying for transit access
* Paying for docking access
* Paying supplies (e.g. fuel, life support supplies)

# Gaining Relationships

Certain content should be gated by relationships with characters (and orgs?)
For instance, access to a sector (and potentially all sectors beyond it) might
be blocked until the player achieves a certain level of relationship. Docking
access might be denied.

* Sector access (being in a sector)
* Travel gate access (using a travel gate), or cheaper transit fees
* Docking permission, or cheaper docking fees
* Trading (certain) goods
* "Allowed" to mine asteroids (without threatening hostilities)
* Hostile/Friendly status in general

Does this imply that characters (or orgs?) "own" sectors?

Relationship could be gained through:

* Scripted event chains (storylets?)
* Missions for that character/faction
* Trading goods with that character/faction
* Buy/Sell intel with that character/faction
* Defend character/faction in combat
* Kill character/faction "enemies" where that character/faction can observe it
* Bribery?

Relationships could be harmed through:

* Scripted event chains
* Missions that harm another character/faction
* Being in a sector you're not allowed
* Mining asteroids you're not allowed
* Trading or carrying goods you're not allowed
* Having debts with a character/faction
* Killing/combat with a character/faction
* Charging for transit or docking access

# Gaining Subordinates

Having subordinates might be a goal in and of itself for a player (e.g.
building eyour own space empire). But having subordinates also accelerates
other kinds of progresssion. Subordinates can do various things of interest for
the player (or other characters):

* Miners working for you to earn money and gather resources for production
* Traders working for you to earn money and gather goods for production
* Run stations
* Crew ships and stations
* Do tasks to complete scripted event chains
* Run missions for you
* Defend your property, stations, gates, asteroids, ships, sectors and enforce
  rules you might set
* Gather intel or create news for you
* Improve their skills/abilities to do these things
* Be subjects in event chains (e.g. one of your subordinates needs a favor)

Subordinates earn wages, costing you money. There's also some level of
management the player needs to be involved in.
