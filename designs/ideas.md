## Ideas

### Comms Chatter

Have a broadcast channel in a sector (or localized in some radius in a sector?)
Characters can broadcast a message (hopefully contextually relevant)
This broadcast triggers an event that gets received by other characters and the
player.
Characters can respond to that event in lots of ways. Perhaps with another
broadcast.
Maybe someone calls for help, or announces a special deal on a good, or asks
for directions and other characters react to that with help or directions, or
deliver goods. This might affect trade or relationships.

But maybe this just creates back-and-forth irrelevant chatter. Someone asks for
help, someone else says, "good luck buddy, you're on your own." Or someone else
says, "Anyone know where I can unload a batch of base metals?" and someone else
says, "I've been trying to unload base metals for four cycles. No luck around
here." And then someone else responds, "I heard you can find good deals in
sector XYZ" or something. Maybe this is real info, but it doesn't have to be to
create a sense of life.
